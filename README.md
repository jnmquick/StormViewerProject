# UIKit Swift

The goal of this project was to simply layout a UITableView that displays a list of images that open in a new screen
using Apple's framework UIKit.

The project introduced the storyboard interface builder in Xcode and touched on some of the ways to interact between 
the editor and it. I learned how to override the parent class UITableViewController functions; to specify the number of rows
the table should contain, modify the individual cells at each row, and pass in a new view to display when a row is selected.

I used a FileManager object class to access the contents of the file system to receive the images.

I had a few additional tasks as well, which included:
  - adjusting the navigation and row title sizes
  - sorting the images numerically
  - and a challenge of displaying what number image was clicked
    out of how many images.
